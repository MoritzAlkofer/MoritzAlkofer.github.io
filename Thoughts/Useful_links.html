                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY&t=6s">MIT lecture on how to speak by Patrick Winston</a><br>
                Amazing lecture on how to give a good talk. It seems tremendously important not only to do cool things, but to 
                communicate them to others in a way that makes them recognize their coolness, too.<br>
                In his book `the art of doing science and engineering` Richard Hamming says: `All [methods of conveying ideas] are essential — you must
                learn to sell your ideas, not by propaganda, but by force of clear presentation. I am sorry to have to point this out; 
                many scientists and others think good ideas will win out automatically and need not be carefully presented. They are wrong; 
                many a good idea has had to be rediscovered because it was not well presented the first time, years before! \
                New ideas are automatically resisted by the establishment, and to some extent justly. The organization cannot 
                be in a continual state of ferment and change, but it should respond to significant changes.

        <section><h3>Commencement Speeches</h3>
        <p>I know I know. Commencement speeches are cheesy. Old white man talking to young white man about his bright, prosperous future. 
        But I think about it this way: People like Steve Jobs would sit down and think really hard about what they want to tell young people
        who just graduated. <b>Turns out I just graduated.</b> So you get advice from Steve Jobs 
        , and alike specifically targeted to your situation. <b>how cool is that?</b></p>

            - M. Brunnermeier</a><br>
            Excellent paper describing the 2008 financial crisis.
            In the first part Brunnmeier teaches you about all the relevant concepts, such as Credit Default Swaps.
            Equipped with all this knowledge, Brunnermeier sends you on an exiting historical ride, from Bear Stearns to Lehman Bros. <br>
            5/5 total banger.

            The articles seem to be mostly about larger corporations being disrupted. <br>
            It might be interesting to access if consulting, or firms such as Google or Palantir are still worth their reputation.
