    <h1>Biographies</h1>
    <section><h2>General thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            I really like reading Biographies. First, I got into history when I read "Diplomacy" from Henry Kissinger.
            This made me realize just how little I know about the history and workings of China, so I read a Ezra Vogel's 
            biography on Deng Xiaoping. What a relevation! Gone are the drab days in school where I am forced to recount the 
            dates of some supposedly relevant events. <br>
            Biographies allowed me to learn a lot about history, following the path of those who shaped it. Biographies 
            automatically make it a story, for you follow someones life. I assume that it gives you a somewhat distorted
            view of History, overplaying the influence of individuals in one's mind. But then again, some distortion is 
            unavoidable anyways, and the biography makes history so enjoyable, that I am happy to make this trade.<br>
            Also, Biographies let you learn from others. <br>
            My favourite biographies are on Churchill (Andrew Roberts), Deng Xiaoping (Ezra Vogel) and Duveen (Beermann). <br>
            Walter Isaacson's books are also really good. I liked his book on Steve Jobs and even got to meet him at an event at Harvard. 
            I also heard excellent things about Moses (Robert Caro).

    <section><h2>Example: Churchill</h2>
            I loved Churchill for going and seeing for himself. One incredible example of the importance of going and 
            seing for oneself is the fall of singapore in the second world war. Initially he was not concerned with Singapore,
            for it was widely considered to be an impenetrable fortress. When the Japanese were in a position to attack,
            He asked for the status of the sigaporian fortifications and recieved the following telegram:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            Until quite recently all plans were based on repulsing seaborne attacks on island and holding 
            land attack in Johore [located in the southern portion of the Malay Peninsula] or farther north,
            and little or nothing was done to construct defences on north side of the island to prevent crossing 
            Johore Straits, though arrangements have been made to blow up the causeway.

        </blockquote>
            The japanese had realized this too and, after invaded Malaya first, took singapore from the north. Churchill greatly
            regretted his mistake.

        <blockquote>
            I do not write this in any way to excuse myself. I ought to have known. My advisers ought to have known 
            and I ought to have been told, and I ought to have asked. The reason I had not asked about this matter,
            amid the thousands of questions I put, was that the possibility of Singapore having no landward defences
            no more entered into my mind than that of a battleship being launched without a bottom.

    <section><h2>Application: Palantir</h2>
        Learning from situations like this you can use the information in different contexts, such as Palantir's "Forward 
        Deployed Engineering" team.
        <blockquote>
            The golden nugget in this philosophy is that you don't worry about how to ask users the right questions or obsess
            over “interviewing” them. Instead, you are literally there, in the shit with them, getting involved in what is happening.
            In the early days at Palantir, this meant flying to war zones carrying a bunch of laptops to where U.S. 
            forces actually engaged the enemy.

    <section><h2>Executing fast</h2>
        <p>
            The examples are countless, and it would be a great deal of fun to revisit some books and distil what I learned from them. 
            Unfortunately, I am looking for a job and this would be too much a distraction. 
            For now, the last point will be Churchill's sense of urgency, examplified by his famous stickers:
