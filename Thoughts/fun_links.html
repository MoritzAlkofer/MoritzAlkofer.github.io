                    In this paper hayek introduces the knowledge problem or the 'problem of the utilization
                    of knowledge which is not given to anyone in its totality'.<br>
                    Different members of society have different knowledge. Decisions should be made
                    by those with the best information at hand, which is typically not a central government.

                    In the 18th century there were a great deal of deaf people on Martha's Vineyard, due hereditary deafness in a to a 
                    small population with little turnover As so many people were deaf, both hearing and blind people used sign language. 
                    As such, being deaf was (almost) no hinderance. The situation stopped when migration to the mainland increased in the 
                    19th century, due to tourism and americas school for the deaf opening on the mainland.

                    Stigler's law claims that no scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer. Stigler attributed the
                    discovery of the law to Robert K. Merton, from whom Stigler stole credit so that it would be an example of the law.

                    Like everyone else, weather forecasters optimize for what they measure. One would assume that they measure forecasting accuracy.
                    In fact, they measure viewer quotes. A viewer expecting a sunny day who is suprised by rain will be very annoyed, and switch forecaster. 
                    A viewer expecting rain, being suprised by a sunny day (delightful) is much less likely to change forecaster. Therefore, forecasters 
                    developed a 'wet bias', overpredicting the likelyhood of rain.
