    <section><h2>Second mover advantage</h2>
        Why does the second person in a field often understand it better? Why did Einstein fight Quantum mechanics, even though 
        he himself contributed largely to its foundations?
        <blockquote>
        The reason this happens is that the creators have to fight through so many dark difficulties, 
        and wade through so much misunderstanding and confusion, they cannot see the light as others can, 
        now the door is open and the path made easyâ€¦. in time the same will probably be true of you.`

    <section><h2>Company size</h2>
        <p>at different company sizes you get confronted with different levels of structure. <br>
        at a small company, you have no structure at all. <br>
        at a mid sized company, you have some structure. <br>
        at a large sized company, you have a lot of structure. <br>
        at the largest companies, government, you have the most structure. <br>
        you can replace the word structure with bureaucracy. <br>
        <br>
        The more structure you have, the more your success is measured in rules set by the structure, not the real world. <br>
        As such, the more structure increase, the more you can advance by complying with the rules, not the real world. <br>
        <br>
        Of course, complying with the rules can mean to produce meaningful work. It can also mean gaming the system, via politics or producing
        visibility. <br>
        <br><br>
        Typically the value is created on the company level. The value is the average of everybody contributing to it. 
        Companies try to measure out how much everybody contributed, but it is rather hard.

    <section><h2>Staying ahead of the curve</h2>
        <p>Paul G wrote in his great essay <a href="https://paulgraham.com/hs.html">What You'll Wish You'd Known</a> that when you do not know 
            what exactly you want to do you should stay upwind. Upwind as in `work forward from promising situations`.  <br>
            In school, physics is upwind of mechanical engineering, for a physicist can become a mechanical engineer, but it is difficult 
            to go the other way around. Math is the upwindiest subject of them all, for it is at the foundation of almost all hard science. 
            <br>
            Now, post college, what does it mean to stay upwind? In the very past it seemed to be accounting. This got replaced by consulting. 
            what is it now???</p>

    <section><h2>Language and symbols</h2>
        What is language? A system of symbols that allow to communicate concepts. A good language allows to communicate concepts efficiently.
        To do so, a language uses symbols. Symbols represent concepts themself and are the essential unit of all communication.
        As such language is never made in a vacuum and depends on previously defined symbols.

        An interesting example of people thinking about symbols is the field of 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_nuclear_waste_warning_messages">Nuclear semiotics</a>. It tries to find symbols
        working without context to deter people from entering nuclear waste sites.

    <section><h2>Bureaucrats</h2>
        Personally, I am not a fan of the bureaucrat. Sometimes I try to fight them. For example I found great joy
        in reading the study regulations of my studies to look for loopholes. But at the end of the day I hope There
        would be less bureaucrats.
        <blockquote>
            Most of the time each person is immersed in the details of one special part of the whole and does
             not think of how what they are doing relates to the larger picture. It is characteristic of most people
             to keep a myopic view of their work and seldom, if ever, connect it with the larger aims they will admit,
             when pressed hard, are the true goals of the system. <b>this myopic view is the chief characteristic of the bureaucrat.</b>

                Why do I say this? In the past year I read a lot of really long books where people would fight on horses.
