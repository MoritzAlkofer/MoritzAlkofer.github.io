            is one of the heuristics Bent Flyvbjerg suggests to 
            <a href="https://sites.prh.com/how-big-things-get-done-book/#about-bent-flyvbjerg">get big things done</a>. 
            I am trying to come up with a vision and a plan. As Louis Pasteur said: 'Luck favours the prepared mind', 
            and I hope to get lucky some day. 
            <br>
            Alas, I try to get prepared first.
            <br><br>
            <br>
            Figuring out what to do with the next couple of years is kind of a big thing for me, so I try to follow this recommendation.

            As usual, Hamming also has some wise words on the issue
            <blockquote>
                “an examination of history and of reports of those who have done great work, all seem to show that
                typically the pattern of creativity is as follows. There is first the recognition of the problem
                in some dim sense. This is followed by a longer or shorter period of refinement of the problem.
                Do not be too hasty at this stage, as you are likely to put the problem in the conventional 
                form and find only the conventional solution. This stage, moreover, requires your emotional 
                involvement, your commitment to finding a solution, since without a deep emotional involvement 
                you are not likely to find a really fundamental, novel solution. 
                <br>
                A long gestation period of intense thinking about the problem may result in a solution, or 
                else the temporary abandonment of the problem. This temporary abandonment is a common feature
                of many great creative acts. The monomaniacal pursuit often does not work; the temporary 
                dropping of the idea sometimes seems to be essential to let the subconscious find a new 
                approach. Then comes the moment of “insight,” creativity, or whatever you want to call 
                it—you see the solution.”
