    <section><h1>Musings on Technology</h2>
        <p> Thinking a bit about technology the term seems kind of fuzzy. Obviously all words 
        are fuzzy when you look at them closely, but as ~Tech~ is so ubiquitous, it seems 
        worthwile to take a closer look. Is AI technology? Sure. Computers. Sure. A loom? 
        Maybe... When it was invented, it was technology for sure, but now it would be described
            as a tool or a machine. So what makes technology? Wikipedia will come to the rescue: 
        <br>
        `Technology is the application of conceptual knowledge to achieve practical goals, especially in a reproducible way.` - Wikipedia 
        This can be either tangible (iPhone)
        <br>
        It is interesting to note just how much this encompasses, much more than computer science! </p></section>
    
    <h2>Large to small</h2>
    <section><h3>Collaboration or why animals use technology</h3>
        <p> Many animals use technology by applying the concept of collaboration (conceptual knowledge), to live and hunt in groups, 
        for it enhances their rate of survival (practical goal). One might object that they do not consciously apply this knowledge. 
        However, most humans are not conscious of technology when they use it, for example when the autopilot their car during the commute. 
        It is not even just animals that apply this technology. </p>
    </section>
    <section><h3>Symbiosis or why cells use technology</h3>
        <p> Cells apply the concept of collaboration to form animals and plants, for it enhances their rate of survival.
        <br> 
        All complex lifeforms are made up from eukaryotic cells, meaning that they contain multiple membrane bound, function specific subunits
        (organelles, such as a nucleus). Even these were formed prokaryotes performing collaboration! Mitochondria have their own genome, 
        and were originally independent, free organisms. They got absorbed into another another cell, either as food or as parasite. 
        Inside the other cell, they not only managed to survive, they proved to be useful by turning oxygen into energy. Since their survival 
        depended on the survival of the engulfing cell, they became part of it. </p>

        </figure></section>
    <section><h3>Replication or why genes use technology</h3>
        <p>Even the cell itself is technology. It tools such as a membrane to increase its chance of replication/survival of the gene.
        And the gene, the original gene was just a random molecule that managed to replicate it self whilst being somewhat stable.
        Some guys even synthesized such a molecule! <a href="#[1]">[1]</a>
        <br>    
        Well at least the animals intuitively know about collaboration, albeit they do not even apply it consciously. Cell collaboration occurs only by chance!
        But then again, does my grandmother Erna know about Shannon when she gives me a call? I do not think so. 
        <br>
        In his book the 'the selfish gene' Richard Dawkins says `We are survival machines for the same kind of replicator - molecules called DNA.`
        So after all we are survival machines, tools to aid DNA survive. 
        <br>
        We are technology, plants are technology, life is technology.
        </p>

    <section><h3>What does art have to say</h3>
        <p>This reminds me of Joseph Beuys: <q>everyone is an artist</q> and Duchamp's <q>anything is art if the artist says it is</q>.
        You might say: <q>life is technology</q>.<br>
        When Beuys became professor of art at the Art college in Duesseldorf, he accepted every student who was otherwise rejected by the school
        into his class, referring to his claim. Similarly, Duchamp put up a toilet in an museum, referring to his claim in similar fashion. 
        Similar to my musings on collaboration, these are fun conceptually, but not very useful from a practial point of view.

    <h2>Old to new</h2>
    <section><h2>Very old days</h2>
        <p> In the very old days humans did not have too much technology. They would roam the woods and look for food. 
        Knowing the features of a good clearing for finding a good mushroom might be considered as technology. You apply conceptual knowledge 
        (what a good, mushroom bearing clearing looks like) to achieve a practical goal (feasting on a tasty mushroom). 
        could be considered technology.<br>
        At the time there were many different kinds of human predecessors, such as the Australopithecus. </p>

    <section><h2>Differntiating from animals</h2>
        3.300.000 years ago came the flake. It was the first tool made using other tools, which is distincly human. 
        (Other animals use tools to, for example by using sticks to get honey).
        They allowed us to to manipulate the world without using our own hands or teeth. Not only was this much more convenient, 
        it was much more effective, too. 
        Sharp stones allowed humans to hunt down large animals, cut them into chunks, to mash plants 
        and smash nuts. This allowed us to gain access to a much wider set of foods: Large animals, bone marrow, seeds etc.
        These tools were made by striking a hammerstone against a core, resulting in sharp flakes.

        This was followed by a bunch of other tangible inventions, such as fire, axes, shelters, and fishing.

    <section><h2>all the stuff in between</h2>
        Originally I thought I'd write a little section on the history of technology. But it is kind of boring. A lot of cool things
        were invented. Fire. Irrigation. The printing press. But it is all kind of obviously technology and obviously useful stuff. 
        Reading about it made me nod, but not much more. Exciting things, yes, but I have nothing to say on it. 
    </section>
    <section><h2>Computers and the future</h2>
        Computers are going to dominate science and engineering. And there are reasons for this, which Richard Hamming very well 
        elaborates in his talk <a href="https://youtu.be/AD4b-52jtos?si=TCF04n0IdXjPPjyy&t=2104">Intro to The Art of Doing Science and Engineering</a>
        <br>
        Computers are far far cheaper than human beings – far cheaper, and they’re getting cheaper by the year. Humans are getting more expensive by the year.
        Computers far far faster, accurate and reliable. They have significantly larger bandwidth, both in an out. Humans take really long to (un)learn things, whereas for a computer, you can simply (un)installsome code. 
        Last but not least computers have no boredom!

        <h2>To do </h2>
            Present of technology
            tools (tangible) vs ideas (intangible [such as franchise])
            Will technology take over the world?
            <p>
    </section>
    <section><h2>Frontiers of technology</h2>
        <p style="background-color:tomato;">
            It seems like what many people consider are the frontiers of technology. It is where the conceptual knowledge that 
            is applied to achieve practical goals is developed. Note that knowledge about how do deploy knowledge is knowledge, too!
