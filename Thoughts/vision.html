        Three questions from <a href="https://hbr.org/2010/07/how-will-you-measure-your-life">Clayton Christensen's HBS graduation speech</a>
        <h4> 1. How can I be sure that I’ll be happy in my career?</h4>
        <h4> 2. How can I be sure that my relationships with my spouse and my family become an enduring source of happiness? </h4>
        <h4> 3. How can I be sure I’ll stay out of jail? </h4>

    <section><h2>Some great quotes from Richard Hamming on vision:</h2>
        <blockquote>The unexamined life is not worth living.<footer>- Hamming quoting Socatrates</footer></blockquote>

        <blockquote>It is well known the drunken sailor who staggers to the left or right with n independent random steps will, 
        on the average, end up about √n steps from the origin. But if there is a pretty girl in one direction,
        then his steps will tend to go in that direction and he will go a distance proportional to n. In a lifetime of many,
        many independent choices, small and large, a career with vision will get you a distance proportional to n, 
        while no vision will get you only the distance √n. In a sense, the main difference between those who go far 
        and those who do not is some people have a vision and the others do not and therefore can only react to the current events 
        as they happen… having a vision is what tends to separate the leaders from the followers.

        <blockquote>If you do not work on important problems, how can you expect to do important work? Yet direct observation and direct
        questioning of people show most scientists spend most of their time working on things they believe are not important and are not 
        likely to lead to important things.
        <footer> - Richard Hamming in The art of doing science and engineering</footer></blockquote>
        <blockquote>The chief gain is in the effort to change yourself, in the struggle with yourself, and it is less in the winning than you might expect.
        Yes, it is nice to end up where you wanted to be, but the person you are when you get there is far more important. 
        I believe a life in which you do not try to extend yourself regularly is not worth living—but it is up to you to pick the goals 
        you believe are worth striving for.

        <blockquote>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly 
            satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work 
            is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As 
            with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.

            Going to Harvard I just new. Working in an environment like this is it.
        <blockquote>the powerful motivator in our lives isn’t money; it’s the opportunity to learn,
             grow in responsibilities, contribute to others, and be recognized for achievements. 
            <footer>- Frederick Herzberg</footer>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>It’s quite startling that a significant fraction of the 900 students that HBS draws each year from the world’s
             best have given little thought to the purpose of their lives. I tell the students that HBS might be one of their last 
             chances to reflect deeply on that question. If they think that they’ll have more time and energy to reflect later, 
             they’re nuts, because life only gets more demanding: You take on a mortgage; you’re working 70 hours a week; 
             you have a spouse and children.<footer>- Clayton Christensen, HBS graduation speech</footer></blockquote>

    <h2>Appendix</h2>
    <section id="convex_tinkering"><h3>Convex tinkering</h3>
    Nassim Taleb defines nonlinear convex bets “low-cost mistakes, with known maximum losses, and large potential payoff (unbounded)”.
    To find these bets you need to have enough understanding to properly estimate pain and gain.
