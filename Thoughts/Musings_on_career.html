        <section><h3>Companies</h3>
            Some companies might add a unique spin on the top points. 
            <ol>
                <li>Palantir</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>No sales people. Engineers go directly to the customer, to really find out how the software is used and deployed.</li>
                    <li>Some articles on what makes Palantir special: <a href="https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/the-unconventional-palantir-principles">The unconventional Palantir principles that catalyzed a generation of startups</a> | 
                        <a href="https://apoorv03.com/p/palantir-the-founder-foundry">The founder foundry</a>
                </ul>
                <li>Google</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        20% time rule: Engineers get to spend 20% of their time on whatever they think is most benefitial for Google. This 
                        produced google news, Gmail and even AdSense!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Stripe</li>
                <li>OpenAI</li>
                <li>Google Deepmind</li>
                <li>Nvidia?</li>
                <li>Just running your own</li>
            </li>
            </ol>
            It seems noteworthy that all the firms listed above are large, really large. Do they produce so many successful founders because
            size comes with some innate qualities, or is it simply the law of large numbers?. <br>
            After some thinking I assume that they have the qualities listed above <b>and</b> the law of large numbers. 
            Any firm that fulfills the above criteria should be a mini founders foundry.

        <section><h2>Consulting</h2>
            <p>
                When thinking about the Palantirs and Googles, one must think about the BCGs and McKinseys and Bains, too.
                They produced a lot of successful founders, they produced a lot of successful executives.
                When I look at my parent's generation, many of those whom I find inspiring did consulting in the past.
                Alas, I ask myself: 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>What is it that made consulting such formidable school in the past? Is it the points listed above?</li>
                <li>Is consulting still a formidable school in the present?</li>
                <li>The world has changed. Is consulting still relevant? If yes, how did it adapt? If no, what did it miss?</li>
            </ol>

        <section><h2>Disclaimer</h2>
            I am a child of my time. A confirmation biased child of my time. I read a lot from people Paul Graham and the like,
            who are really into startups. Everyone is talking about startups. <br>
            There could be a great time outside of startups. Management for example? It seems like in the past everyone
            wanted to be a manager.
            <blockquote>
                Management is the most noble of professions if it's practiced well. 
                No other occupation offers as many ways to help others learn and grow, take responsibility 
                and be recognized for achievement, and contribute to the success of a team.

            </blockquote>
            I feel like i truly value tackling a good problem, coming up with odd solutions. I also hate bureaucracy and corporate politics. 
            I am really passionate about learning stuff. <br>
            Regardless, would I have dreamed about becoming a manager in a large multinational if I was born some decades ago?
            I would greatly appreciate your thoughts, especially if you know me well! Just use the feedback form linked on the homepage.
