        <section><h3>Companies</h3>

        <section><h3>Work at Palantir</h3>
            A lot of people seem to have worked at Palantir before they went on to fund other startups. Some of the things that I found out about why
            <ol>
                <li>No sales people. Engineers going to the customer, to really find out how the software is used and deployed</li>
                <li>Flat hirachies</li>
                <li>Fast iteration</li>
            </ol>

        <section><h2>Consulting</h2>
            <p>
                When thinking about the Palantirs and Googles, one must think about the BCGs and McKinseys and Bains, too.<br>
                They produced a lot of successful founders, they produced a lot of successful exec.<br>
                When I look at my parent's generation, many of those whom I find inspiring did consulting in the past. <br>
                Alas, I ask myself: 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>What is it that made consulting such formidable school in the past?</li>
                <li>Is consulting still a formidable school in the present?</li>
                <li>The world has changed. Is consulting still relevant? If yes, how did it adapt? If no, what did it miss?</li>
            </ol>

        <section><h2>Disclaimer</h2>
            I am a child of my time. A biased child of my time. I read a lot from people Paul Graham and the like, who are really into startups. 
            Everyone is talking about startups. <br>
            There could be a great time outside of startups. Management for example? It seems like in the past everyone wanted to be a manager. 
            I would greatly appreciate your thoughts on bias! 
            <blockquote>
                My conclusion: Management is the most noble of professions if it's practiced well. 
                No other occupation offers as many ways to help others learn and grow, take responsibility 
                and be recognized for achievement, and contribute to the success of a team.
