        <h1>Chickpeas</h1>
        <p>
            I have thought a lot about the question of what is the best food. I am willing to die on the following hill: 
            "The canned chickpea is the best food"<br>
            Food goodness can be well measured along the following five metrics: Taste, price, shelf life, nutrition, prep time.
            The canned chickpea is the only food I know which excells in all 5 categories. 
            The canned chickpea offers a version of the  <a href="#towel">intergalactic hitchhiker's towel</a> to the pedestrain earthwalker.
            The canned chickpea will be there when you get home and need a quick, tasty, nutrutious snack. It will be there when you 
            want to create an elaborate salad. It will be there for you tomorrow, and it will be there just as much 
            if you forget it and let it wait in the pantry for a couple of years. 
        </p>
        <h2>Evaluation metrics</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Taste</h3>
                    <p>The canned chickpea has an outstanding lower bound for taste. Post draining, you can eat it right from the can and it will taste decent.
                        You can alleviate the taste <b>a lot</b> by adding salt and olive oil. Low cost, incredibly fast.

                    <h3>Price</h3>
                    <p>Chickpeas are cheap. Really cheap. Yesterday I bought 400g cans of chickpeas for 60ct a can.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Shelf life</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Near inifite.</b>
                        Actually Napoleon enabled the invention of canned food. He recognized that an army 'travels on its stomach' and that 
                        an effective army required good, unspoiled food, even when far away from home. (he also took great care of everybody's shoes, 
                        for an army travels not only on its stomach, but also on its feet). <br>
                        To ensure the presence of good, unspoiled food whereever his army was, he set out a price of 12.000 Francs. Although he did not 
                        know how it worked, Nicolas Appert invented canning. Half a century later, Lois Pasteur provided the corresponding theory. 
                        <a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/861564/how-napoleon-influenced-the-canned-food-industry/">One of many available sources</a>

                        As you have surely experienced yourself, shelf life is important outside of the Napoleonic army. Few things hit the esprit d'Corps as
                        hard as looking forward to your favourite snack, only to find it spoilt. Never will this pain fall upon you if you choose 
                        your favourite food wisely, if you choose the canned chickpea. 
                        <br>
                        The canned chickpea will stay good for longer than the container that holds your soul, so no need to worry. 
                        However, there is need to celebrate: You can buy chickpeas in bulk. Economies of scale apply. You do not need to take care of them. 
                        You will <b>always</b> have food at home when you get home.

                    <h3>Nutrition</h3>
                        Given that I am not a trustworthy source when it comes to nutrition, I will quote the Mayo clinic:
                        <blockquote>[Chickpeas are] a nutrient powerhouse, budget-friendly protein and versatile choice for
                            year-round healthy eating. Naturally low in saturated fat, loaded with nutrients
                            Nearly three-quarters of Americans exceed the daily recommended amount of saturated fat, 
                            much of which comes from animal-based proteins, such as beef, pork and full-fat dairy products. 
                            One of the best ways to lower saturated fat intake is to add more plant-based proteins, including chickpeas, 
                            to your diet. While naturally low in saturated fat, chickpeas are nutrient-dense. 
                            They provide nearly 20 grams of protein in a ½-cup serving and 5 grams of dietary fiber. 
                            Chickpeas also are a source of folate, iron, vitamin C and phosphorus.

                    <p>
                        Canned chickpeas require no cooking. They taste great the way they are. Adding olive oil, salt, and lemon again requires no
                        cooking time whatsoever, but elevates the chickpeas already heavenly flavour to the olymp of food. Again, with very little
                        cooking time you can make a delicious salad, for example by adding a dressing of dijon mustard (Fun link showing 
                        that france ran out of mustard, fun example of the importance of globalisation).

    <h2>Appendix</h2>
    <section id="towel"><h2>Towel</h2>
        Towel definition according to the The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (travel guide), which, according to its introductory
        page “[...] has already supplanted the great Encyclopaedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom,
         for though it has many omissions ... it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects. 
        First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words DON'T PANIC inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover.”
        <blockquote>
        <p>
            A towel is just about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can carry. Partly because it has great
             practical value. You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie 
             on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it
              beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy 
              River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand combat; wrap it around your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the 
              gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mind-bogglingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see 
              it, it can't see you — daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a 
              distress signal, and of course you can dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.
        </p>
        <p>
        More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag discovers that a hitchhiker has
         his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, washcloth, soap, tin 
         of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the 
         strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitchhiker might accidentally 
         have "lost." What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the Galaxy, rough it, 
         slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through and still knows where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with.
        </p>
        <p>
        Hence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking slang, as in "Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There's a frood 
        who really knows where his towel is."
