                    Please be aware that this homepage is still work in progress. I use it to sort my thoughts on what to do. 
                    <br>
                    Im taking some time to do this. Here I think about why it's sensible to <a href="Thoughts/taking_time_to_think.html">'think slow, move fast'</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might find parts of this website odd. Stupid or annoying even. This is ok.
                    I put it up on purpose. This is what I am like. It's a filter, for both of us. 
                    I am happy to chat about the <a href="Thoughts/concorde.html">Concorde</a>, but it would be a pity for both of us to 
                    talk for great lengths or even work together only to find out that you hate dislike people who like thinking about the Concorde.
